# ROUTING-PROTOCOLS-IN-WIRED-NETWORK-Distance-Vector-Routing-and-Link-State-Routing.
To evaluate the performance of routing protocols, Distance Vector Routing Protocol and Link State Routing Protocol in wired network using NS2.

First run the TCL File using command :

ns exp4dvr.tcl

Then 2 files will be created named exp4dvr.tr and exp4dvr.nam

Then run awk file using command :

awk -f exp4dvr.awk exp4dvr.tr

Do the same for LSR also.
